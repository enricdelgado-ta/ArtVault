## 📝 Notes

- Profile pictures are exchangable (each user selects one) so they have to follow the standard
	- [ ] Square
	- [ ] PoT (or at least divisible by 4)
	- [ ] No outter drop shadows
- Frames might be exchangable (league frames, vanity purchases...) so it's better if they follow the same standard as the profile pictures
